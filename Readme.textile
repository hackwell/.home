This is my home dir, settings for zsh, dot files and so on ...

h1. Installation

Installation is very simple, you just have to clone this repository to your home dir:

@git clone git@github.com:hackwell/.home.git $HOME/.home@

cd into the newly created directory and run install.sh

@cd $HOME/.home && ./install.sh@

.home will then clone the oh-my-zsh repository and create a symlink in your home dir .zshrc to adjust $PATH as well as set zsh preferences.
